# Decentralized Token Swapping

Find more about this project on my blog ----> [www.adityabonde.hashnode.dev](https://adityabonde.hashnode.dev/exploring-the-customswaptoken-smart-contract-understanding-decentralized-token-swapping)
This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
